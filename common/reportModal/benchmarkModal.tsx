                    The <b> Benchmarked column</b> shows you the performance of the student on all summative questions aligned to an objective for which the student has completed the formative assessments (indicated by a circle). In the above example, there were 19 of these questions. The student answered 18 correctly resulting in a score of 95%.

                    This benchmark allows you to compare the performance of those questions on the summative where the student has taken the formatives aligned to the questionâ€™s objective to those questions where the formatives were not completed.
